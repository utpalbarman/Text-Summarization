# **ABSTRACT of the Work**
Automatic text summarization is part of the field of natural language processing, which is
how computers can analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language. The
automatic text summarization algorithm is able to function in a variety of situationsthat other
implementations might struggle with, such as documents containing foreign languages or
unique word associations that aren’t found in standard English language corpuses. Business
leaders, analysts, paralegals, and academic researchers need to combthrough huge numbers of
documents every day to keep ahead, and a large portion of their time is spent just figuring out
what document is relevant and what isn’t. By extracting important sentences and creating
comprehensive summaries, it’s possible to quickly assess whether or not a document is worth
reading. Automatic textsummarization is also useful for students and authors, being able to
automaticallygenerate an abstract based for their research paper or chapter in a book in a clear
and concise way that is faithful to the original source material.
Through this project we strive for generation of a common interface to perform domain
agnostic extractive summarization of textual data using state-of-the-art machine learning
algorithms and derive concise relevant summarized texts.We also conducted comparative
analysis of three unsupervised extractive summarization algorithms leveraging statistical ,
topic-modelling and graph based approaches on various domains of a benchmark dataset
which is evaluated using standard ROUGE metrics encompassing precision , recall and Fmeasure as well as gaining valuable insights through graphical representation of the obtained
evaluation and further designing of an interactive interface based on the optimal algorithm
from the comparative analysis to tackle the multiple use case scenarios of extractive
summarization
